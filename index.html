  Goal: Create a postcard of Bhutan.
Style it how ever you like. 
You can refer online or offline for inspiration.

These are some must have feature for this digital postcard.
1. The main h1 text should be using the Regular (400) Yeseva One Font from Google Fonts:
2. The text should be white and background black.
3. Add your own image into the images folder inside assets. It should have a 5px white border.
4. The text should be center aligned.
5. Create a div to contain the h1, p and img elements. Adjust the margins so that the image and text are centered on the page. 
  Hint: You horizontally center a div by giving it a width of 50% and a margin-left of 25%.
  Hint: Set the image to have a width of 100% so it fills the div. 
6. Read about the text-transform property on w3schools to make the h1 uppercase with CSS.
